- 👋 Hi, I’m @DrSadiqfareed
- 👀 I’m interested in advancing research in Artificial Intelligence, Computer Vision, and Optical Character Recognition (OCR). My work primarily focuses on deep learning models for real-world applications like medical diagnostics, intelligent surveillance, and handwritten text recognition.
- 🌱 I’m currently enhancing my expertise in Transformer-based architectures and exploring their applications in complex data analysis and text recognition.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that push the boundaries of machine learning and AI, particularly those involving interdisciplinary research and large-scale data.
- 📫 How to reach me: You can reach me at sadiqfareed@mail.xjtu.edu.cn or connect with me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/F4Sadiq).
- 😄 Pronouns: He/Him
- ⚡ Fun fact: When I’m not working on AI projects, I enjoy exploring different languages and cultures—having earned a Chinese Language Certificate during my studies in China!
